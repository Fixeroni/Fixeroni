# Fixeroni - Your Social Authentication Solution ðŸš€

### Updates
Hey everyone, so here's what I've done for the week from 12 February 2025 to 19 February 2025

### What we've done
We've simplified how users sign up by focusing on three main things:
- **Fixeroni Tag**: Your unique username in the app
- **Email**: Your email address (don't worry, we'll keep it safe!)
- **First Name**: Because it's nice to know who we're talking to!

### Sign In Options
You can now sign in using:
- Your email and password
- Google account
- Facebook account
- Apple ID (yep, we've got that working now!)

### Behind the Scenes Improvements ðŸ› 
- Added better security for handling passwords
- Made sure you can't get locked out by adding refresh tokens
- Added protection against too many login attempts
- Made email validation better (no more fake emails!)

### Coming Soon ðŸ”œ
- Email verification
- Profile pictures
- More social login options# Fixeroni

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
